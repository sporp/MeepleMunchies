#Meeple MashUp General Guide

-Clockwise Turn Order
-Move your piece, then perform an action (Attack, Shove, Munch, Heal)

##ROUND START
-Place Cards in order that you want your pieces to go
-Every player rolls their initiative die. The player with the highest result goes first. If any players tie for highest, those players reroll until somebody wins.
-1 by 1, each player flips their leftmost face-down card. That player takes a turn with that piece, then passes turn.
-Repeat until all players have flipped all cards & taken their turn
-If only 1 player has pieces remaining in action, that player wins. Otherwise return to ROUND START

##TURN
-A turn happens as follows:
-Flip your leftmost face-down card
-Move your piece up to its number of moves, then you may perform an action
-Pass turn

##COMBAT
-If a piece's life total is reduced to 0, it is knocked down in place. Remove its die from the health tracker.
-Pieces that are knocked down may be "revived" by the healer
-You can perform actions with a revived piece if it is revived BEFORE its card is flipped
