# Meeple MashUp General Guide

-Clockwise Turn Order

## ROUND START
-Place Cards in order that you want your pieces to go
-Every player rolls their initiative die. The player with the highest result goes first. If any players tie for highest, those players reroll until somebody wins.
-1 by 1, each player flips their leftmost face-down card. That player takes a turn with that piece, then passes turn.
-Repeat until all players have flipped all cards & taken their turn
-If only 1 player has pieces remaining in action, that player wins. Otherwise return to ROUND START

## TURN

A turn happens as follows:
  1) Flip your leftmost face-down card
  2) Move your Meeple UP TO the number of moves it has
  3) Perform an action
  4) Pass turn

_You don't have to move, you don't have to perform an action, but after an ACTION you cannot MOVE_

## ACTIONS
Your meeple can perform ONE of the following actions per turn:
1) ATTACK
2) SHOVE
3) MUNCH

Additionally, a HEALER CAN:
4) HEAL 
5) REVIVE

## COMBAT
-If a piece's life total is reduced to 0, it is knocked down in place. Remove its die from the health tracker.
-Pieces that are knocked down may be "revived" by the healer
-You can perform actions with a revived piece if it is revived BEFORE its card is flipped
