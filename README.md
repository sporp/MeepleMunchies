# Meeple MashUp General Guide

-Clockwise Turn Order

## ROUND START
1) Place Cards in order that you want your pieces to go
2) Every player rolls their initiative die. The player with the highest result goes first. If any players tie for highest, those players reroll until somebody wins.
3) 1 by 1, each player flips their leftmost face-down card. That player takes a turn with that piece, then passes turn.
4) Repeat until all players have flipped all cards & taken their turn
5) If only 1 player has pieces remaining in action, that player wins. Otherwise return to ROUND START

## TURN

A turn happens as follows:
  1) Flip your leftmost face-down card
  2) Move your Meeple UP TO the number of moves it has
  3) Perform an action
  4) Pass turn

_After an ACTION you cannot MOVE. You don't have to MOVE, you don't have to perform an ACTION

## ACTIONS
Your meeple can perform ONE of the following actions per turn:
1) ATTACK
2) SHOVE
3) MUNCH
4) HEAL (only HEALER)
5) REVIVE (only HEALER)

## COMBAT
-If a piece's life total is reduced to 0, it is knocked down in place. Remove its die from the health tracker.
-Pieces that are knocked down may be "revived" by the healer
-You can perform actions with a revived piece if it is revived BEFORE its card is flipped
-You can only perform an attack when you are able to damage a target

## MUNCH
-Eat ALL edible pieces (the chicken and knocked down Meeple) in a 1 tile radius INCLUDING the space you are standing on.
-Chicken: give the Meeple munching +2 Health
-Knocked down Meeple: +2 damage added to your NEXT ATTACK. This buff stays on this Meeple UNTIL YOU ATTACK.
_A Munching Meeple gains ALL UNUSED ATTACK BUFFS from the Meeple they eat_
