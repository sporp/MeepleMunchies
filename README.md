# Meeple Munchies General Guide

Clockwise Turn Order

## ROUND START
1) Place Cards in order that you want your pieces to go, from left to right
2) Every player rolls their initiative die. The player with the highest result goes first. If any players tie for highest, those players reroll until somebody wins.
3) 1 by 1, each player flips their leftmost face-down card. That player takes a turn with that piece, then passes turn.
4) Repeat until all players have flipped all cards & taken their turn
5) If only 1 player has pieces remaining in action, that player wins. Otherwise return to ROUND START

## TURN
A turn happens as follows:
  1) Flip your leftmost face-down card
  2) Move your Meeple UP TO the number of moves it has
  3) Perform ONE action
  4) Pass turn

_After an ACTION you cannot MOVE. You don't have to MOVE, you don't have to perform an ACTION

## MOVE
- You may move your Meeple across adjacent tiles UP TO the number of moves it has
- You cannot move through a space that has another piece on it

## ACTIONS
Your meeple can perform ONE of the following actions per turn:
1) ATTACK
2) SHOVE
3) MUNCH
4) HEAL/REVIVE (only HEALER can do this)

## COMBAT
- If a piece's life total is reduced to 0, it is knocked down in place. Remove its die from the health tracker.
- Pieces that are knocked down may be "revived" by the healer
- You can perform actions with a revived piece if it is revived BEFORE its card is flipped
- You can only perform an attack when you are able to damage a target

## MUNCH
- Eat ALL edible pieces (the chicken and knocked down Meeple) in a 1 tile radius INCLUDING the space you are standing on.
- Chicken: give the Meeple munching +2 Health
- Knocked down Meeple:
  - +2 damage added to your NEXT ATTACK. This buff stays on this Meeple UNTIL YOU ATTACK.
  - Eating a knocked down Meeple removes it from the game. Place it next to the health counter of the Meeple that ate it to track your next attack buffs
  - _A Munching Meeple gains ALL UNUSED ATTACK BUFFS from the Meeple they eat_

## SHOVE
- Push Meeple 1 space away from you
- 1 damage to said Meeple if they are shoved onto a water tile

## HEAL/REVIVE
- Healer Meeple can HEAL or REVIVE ANY Meeple, including themselves
- Heal increases a Meeple's health by 1 point
- Revive brings a knocked down Meeple back upright with 1 Health
- _A revived Meeple is no longer knocked down and CANNOT be MUNCHED until it is knocked down again_
